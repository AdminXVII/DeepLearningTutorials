Network for 1D segmentation
***************************

.. note::
    This section assumes the reader has already read through :doc:`lenet` for 
    convolutional networks motivation and :doc:`fcn_2D_segm` for segmentation
    standard network.


Summary
+++++++

The fundamental notions behind segmentation have been explained in :doc:`fcn_2D_segm`.
A particularity here is that some of these notions will be applied to 1D
segmentation. However, almost every Lasagne layer used for 2D segmentation have
their respective 1D layer, so the implementation would look alike if the same
model was used.




Data
++++

The `BigBrain <https://bigbrain.loris.ca/main.php>`__ dataset is a 3D ultra-high resolution model of the brain reconstructed from 2D sections.
We are interested in the outer part of the brain, the cortex.
More precisely, we are interested in segmenting the 6 different layers of the cortex in 3D.
Creating an expertly labelled training dataset with each 2D section (shown in figure 1) is unfeasible. Instead of giving as input a 2D image of one section of the brain, we give as input 1D vectors with information from across the cortex, extracted from smaller portions of manually labelled cortex
as shown in Figure 2. The actual dataset can be found `here TODO: link the dataset`.

    **Figure 2** : Ray extraction from segmentated cortex

We will call *rays* the vectors of size 200 going from outside the brain and
through the cortex. As the images were stained for cell bodies, the intensity of each pixel of these rays represents the cell densities
and sizes contained in the cortical layer to which the pixel belongs. Since the 6 cortical layers
have different properties (cell density and size), the intensity profile can be used to
detect boundaries of the cortical layers.

Each ray has 2 input channels, one representing the smoothed intensity and the other,
the raw version, as shown in Figure 3. The next figure, Figure 4, shows the
ground truth segmentation map, where each different color represent
a different label. The purple color indicate that these pixels are
outside the cortex, while the 6 other colors represent the 6 cortical layers.
For example, the first layer of the cortex is between pixels ~ 35-55. The cortex
for this sample starts at pixel ~35 and ends at pixel ~170.

Model
+++++

We first started our experiment with more complex models, but we finally found that
the simpler model present here had enough capacity to learn how and where the layer boundaries are.
This model (depicted in Figure 5) is composed of 8 identical blocks, followed by a
last convolution and a softmax non linearity.

Each block is composed of :

* Batch Normalization layer
* Rectify nonlinearity layer
* Convolution layer, with kernel size 25, with enough padding such that the convolution does not change the feature resolution, and 64 features maps

The last convolution has kernel size 1 and *number of classes* feature maps.
The softmax is then
used to detect which of these classes is more likely for each pixel.
Note that any input image size could be used here, since the model is built from
locally connected layers exclusively.

    **Figure 5** : Model

Note that we didn't use any pooling, because it was not needed. However, if
pooling layers were used, an upsampling path would have been necessary to recover full
spatial size of the input ray. Also, since each pixel of the output prediction has
a receptive field that includes all of the input pixel, the network is able to extract
enough contextual information.







Results
+++++++

The model outputs a vector of the same size as the input (here, 200).
There are 7 class labels, including the 6 cortical layers and the 'not in the brain yet'
label. You can see in Figure 6 below the output of the model for some ray. The top
of the plot represent the ground truth segmentation, while the bottoms represent
the predicted segmentation. As you can see, there is only a small number of pixels
not correctly segmented.

    **Figure 6** : Ground truth (top) vs prediction (bottom) for 1 ray

However, since the purpose was to do 3D segmentation by using 1D segmentation
of the rays, we needed to put back the rays on the brain section. After interpolation
between those rays and smoothing, we get the results shown in Figure 7. The colored
lines are from 3D meshes based on the prediction from the model, intersected with a 2D section, and the grayscale stripes correspond to the
ground truth. As you can see, it achieves really good results on the small manually labelled
sample, which extend well to previously unsegmented cortex.

Code
++++

The FCN implementation can be found in the following file:

* `fcn1D.py <../code/cnn_1D_segm/fcn1D.py>`_ : Main script. Defines the model.
* `train_fcn1D.py <../code/cnn_1D_segm/train_fcn1D.py>`_ : Training loop

Change the *dataset_loaders/config.ini* file and add the right path for the dataset:

[cortical_layers]

shared_path = /data/lisa/exp/vazquezd/datasets/cortical_layers/


First define a *bn+relu+conv* block that returns the name of the last layer of
the block. Since the implementation uses a dictionary variable *net* that keeps
the layer's name as key and the actual layer object as variable, the name of the
last layer is sufficient 

.. literalinclude:: ../code/cnn_1D_segm/fcn1D.py
  :start-after: start-snippet-bn_relu_conv
  :end-before: end-snippet-bn_relu_conv

The model is composed of 8 of these blocks, as seen below. Note that the
model implementation is very tweakable, since the depth (number of blocks), the
type of block, the filter size are the number of filters can all be changed by user.
However, the hyperparameters used here were:

* filter_size = 25
* n_filters = 64
* depth = 8
* block = bn_relu_conv
  
.. literalinclude:: ../code/cnn_1D_segm/fcn1D.py
  :start-after: start-snippet-convolutions
  :end-before: end-snippet-convolutions
  
Finally, the last convolution and softmax are achieved by :
  
.. literalinclude:: ../code/cnn_1D_segm/fcn1D.py
  :start-after: start-snippet-output
  :end-before: end-snippet-output
